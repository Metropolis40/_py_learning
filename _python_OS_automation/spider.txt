 creating variables and passing parameters to our functions with the values that we wanted. This works fine for small scripts, but it's usually not ideal for larger jobs. When processing large chunks of data, it's a good idea to read that data from files. In programming, we work with files all the time. It's such a useful task that most programming languages have the ability to work with files baked into the core set of features. Python is no exception. It gives us file objects which we can use to read and write to files. To open a file on a computer called spider.txt, we can write this code.

What we're doing here is creating a new file object and assigning it to a variable called File. The parameter we've passed to the open function is the name of the file we want to open. In this case, we're assuming the file we want to read is in the same directory as a script we're running but we
